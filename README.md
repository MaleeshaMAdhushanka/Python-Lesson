# Python Basics Learning Project

This repository contains materials for learning Python basics through practical examples in Jupyter notebooks.

## Contents

The main notebook `first_jupeter.ipynb` covers:

1. **Basic Operations and Variable Types**
   - Arithmetic operations
   - Variable assignment
   - Type conversion
   - Exploring data types (int, float, complex)

2. **Python Lists in Detail**
   - Creating and accessing list elements
   - List indexing and slicing
   - List modification methods:
     - Updating elements
     - Adding elements (append, insert, extend)
     - Removing elements (remove, pop, del)
   - List operations:
     - Length calculation
     - Sorting (ascending and descending)
     - Copying lists (shallow vs. deep copy)
     - Reversing lists
     - Joining lists

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter notebook in VS Code or any Jupyter-compatible environment
2. Run the cells sequentially to understand each concept
3. Experiment by modifying the code examples

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter notebook support (VS Code with Python extension or Jupyter Lab)
